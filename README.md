# Fixed_Income_Butterfly_Trades

Treasury butterfly trade that is neutral to the first two principal components of yield curve movements, isolating pure exposure to curvature. PCA on yield changes to identify and interpret level, slope, and curvature factors. Design a mean-reversion trading strategy on the curvature factor, backtest it across market regimes (pre-COVID, QE, hiking cycle), and analyze the gap between yield-space returns and actual bond-level implementation.

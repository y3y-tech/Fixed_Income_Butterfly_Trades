    "### Question 5: Implementation Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare yield-space P&L to bond-space returns.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question confronts the gap between academic factor analysis and implementable trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **Design a roll schedule.** Using the bond panel (`treasury_panel_pca.xlsx`), you need to select actual bonds to proxy 2Y, 5Y, and 10Y maturities. Decide on:\n",
    "   - **Roll frequency:** monthly or quarterly?\n",
    "   - **Selection criteria:** closest TTM to target? Prefer on-the-run (low `age_days`)?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Document your choices and rationale. There is no single correct answer—tradeoffs exist between tracking error, transaction costs, and liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Construct the butterfly using actual bonds.** At each roll date:\n",
    "   - Select the bond closest to each target maturity (2Y, 5Y, 10Y)\n",
    "   - Apply your PCA-neutral weights, scaled by duration\n",
    "   - Hold these bonds until the next roll date\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Compute daily bond returns between roll dates (price changes plus accrued interest changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Compare yield-space vs bond-space P&L.** Compute the correlation and R² between:\n",
    "   - Yield-space butterfly changes (from Question 3)\n",
    "   - Bond-space portfolio returns\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Plot both series on the same chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) **Analyze the sources of discrepancy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Yield changes**: At each timestep, the indivudal bond's yield change will be different than the fixed maturity yield change. This is due to different maturities as well as factors idiosyncratic to the bond itself. How correlated are GSW yield changes with held bond yield changes? Show the relationship with a plot.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - **First-order approxiation**: We can model bond returns from yields via first order approximation via duration. How correlated are our approximated returns to the actual bond returns? Show the relationship with a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) **Discuss:** Is the yield-space backtest a reliable guide to actual trading performance? What adjustments would you make for a production implementation?"
